# Two_Segments_on_Single_Port
Operating two seven segments on single port of micro-controller

- I implemented this project individually during embedded systems internship.
- This project depends on the concept of persistence of vision (POV), which is form of optical illusion, and by applying this concept we can utilize the very high speed of the processor in operating multiple displays at the same time and using the same pins without feeling any difference, this can result in reducing the micro-controller pins used without adding any extra components.
- I used ATmega32 micro-controller to control two seven segments.
- The project is implemented on hardware kit and simulated on Proteus.
